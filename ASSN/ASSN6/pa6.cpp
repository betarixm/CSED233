/*
    [Task 1] Graph Traversals

    Description:
        Implement a function that prints DFS traverse from the given undirected graph.
        The search starts with the vertex that comes first in ascending order.
        The graph follows the ascending order and may consist of several connected graphs.
        If there exist n connected graphs, then print n traverses separated with a newline.
        And make sure that the output follows the ascending order. For example, if there are 3 traverses
        '1 5 8', '0 2 4', '9 10 11', then the output should follow '0 2 4', '1 5 8', '9 10 11' order.
        You can modify graph.cpp and graph.h files for this problem.

        TODO: Implement Graph::addUndirectedEdge and Graph::DFS functions

    Input & output
    Input: Pairs of node labels that indicate edges.
        - (1, 2): an edge between node 1 and node 2.
    Output:
        - DFS traverse separated with a white space
        - Multiple traverses separated with a newline, in ascending order.

    [Task 2] Topological Sort

    Description:
        Implement a function that finds a topological sort from the given directed graph.
        If there exist more than one topological sort, print the topological sort
        that comes first in the ascending order. As an example of the graph below,
        acceptable topological sorts can be '0 1 2 3 5 4', '0 2 1 5 4 3', '0 2 3 1 5 4', etc.
        Among these, the correct output is '0 1 2 3 5 4'. Also, print 'error' if the topological sort
        does not exist. You can modify graph.cpp and graph.h files for this problem.

    [Task 3] Single Source Shortest Path of Graph

    Description:
        Implement a function that finds the shortest path from the source node to the destination node in the given graph.
        We assume that the given graph is a directed, weighted, and weakly-connected graph.
        All weights of edges are positive (i.e. larger than 0).
        This function should return the sequence of node labels along the path and also the length (sum of the weights of the edges) of the path.
        If the path from the source node to the destination node doesn't exist, return 'error'.

    Input: A sequence of commands

    [Task 5] Prim's Algorithm

    Description:
        Implement a function that finds the Minimum-cost Spanning Tree (MST) of the given
        weighted undirected graph using the Prim's algorithm.
        Given a start node, this function start with the single-vertex tree of the given node.
        Then, the function prints the added edge and the weight of the edge each time the tree grows.
        When printing an edge, you first have to print the label of the node that already
        exists in the tree, then print the label of the node that newly inserted into the tree.
        If there are multiple edges with the same weight, this function checks the label of the added node
        (i.e. the node which is not included in the tree) and selects the node with the first label in lexicographical order.
        Finally, the function returns the cost of the MST (i.e. the sum of edge weights).
        You can assume that the given graph is a connected graph.
        You can modify graph.cpp and graph.h files for this problem.

    Output:
        - For each time the tree grows, print the labels of the nodes indicating the added edges
            and the weight of the edge as a string separated with a white space.
        - Print the cost of MST.

    [Task 6] Kruskal's Algorithm

    Description:
        Implement a function that finds the Minimum-cost Spanning Tree (MST) of the given weighted undirected graph using the Kruskal's algorithm.

        When printing an edge, you have to print the label in lexicographical order.
        If there are multiple edges with the same weight, this function also selects the edge in lexicographical order.
        That means it compares the first node of edges, and if the first node is the same, it compares the second node of edges.
